**Predicting the Length Of Stay Using NAÏVE  Bayes, KNN and Random Forest Algorithm:**

Length of stay is the total number of days a patient has stayed in a hospital. There are several factors that affect the length of stay which include bed grade, the severity of illness, admission type etc. The length of a patient’s stay is a key measure of a hospital’s management efficiency. Due to limited resources, hospitals must make optimal use of beds and clinician time. The ability to predict how long a patient will stay based on information available as soon as they arrive at the hospital and are diagnosed can have a number of positive consequences for a hospital’s efficiency. This research has incorporated three different machine learning algorithms like the Gaussian Naïve Bayes algorithm, KNN algorithm and random forest algorithm. The dataset was taken from Kaggle, a publicly open data source. The train and test data were downloaded as the .csv file and a predictive model was created by incorporating these three different ML algorithms. The model was then trained with the required train dataset. The trained model was then used to predict the LOS in test data. The accuracy of the prediction model is identified and is then compared which each other. The best from the three models are taken.
